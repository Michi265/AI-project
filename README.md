15-puzzle

A python application that permits to show differences between A* with Manhattan distance and Database Pattern.

To run the program is necessary execute the file test.py that contains code to execute tests for the two euristics in terms of expansive node, penetrance and effective branching factor. This file uses calls to puzzle.py.

Thanks to http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/python/readme.html for giving me a guideline to start my analysis and thanks to "Richard E.Korf, Ariel Fernel" - Disjoint pattern database heuristics, to permit me to understand in which way database pattern works.
